Goals 
    -write unit tests using jest 

An introduction to Jest 
    -jest is an open source testing platform written by facebook 
    -built on top of jasmine
    -easy to test environments that are not browser based 
    -jestjs.io/en/
    -output comes to terminal 

Installing jest 
    npm i--global jest

Organizing tests   
    test files should be named NAME_OF_FILE.test.js
        you can place in the same directory as the JS file 
        or you can organize them in a test folder __tests__
    if you have package.json, you don't need additional configuration
        if not, create jest.config.js file, it can be empty but you still need one 

DESCRIBE
    to group together related tests, wrap these in describe callback 

Expectations 
    expectations should go inside of test function callbacks 
        a function can have several expectations - but be thoughtful about keeping tests small and simple 
    expect should not be hanging around by itself, it should be in a test function 

jestjs.io/docs/en/using-matchers

most common matchers 
    .toEqual
        has the same value
    .toBe
        is the same object
    .toContain
        does object/array contain this item
    .not.
        add before matcher to invert
            expect('hi').not.toEqual('bye')
 
ANY
    Sometimes oyure not sure whatpart of an object will be 
    use expect.any(type) and it will match any of that type

BEFORE / AFTER
